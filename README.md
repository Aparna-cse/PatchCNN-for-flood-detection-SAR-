## Cloning the repository

Clone the git repository by running git bash in your computer and run the following command

`https://github.com/Aparna-cse/PatchCNN-for-flood-detection-SAR-.git`

or click on the download button and extract the zip file

## Installing dependencies

On a PC running Windows,

Install `MATLAB` with Image Processing toolbox from `https://www.mathworks.com/downloads/`.

Install `Anaconda` from `https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual` and run the following commands in your conda prompt.

`conda install tensorflow keras opencv`

`import tensorflow`

`import keras`

`import cv2`

`conda install imutils scikit-learn`

## Execution of codes 

1. Run patch.m on MATLAB

2. Run CNN Patch.py python code on Anaconda

3. Run Training.py python code on Anaconda

4. Run Testing.py python code on Anaconda

5. The above steps are executed for both before and after Flood in Sentinel 1 images.

8. The final result is stored in 'FloodMap.png'
